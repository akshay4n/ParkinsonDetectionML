Parkinsons' Disease Detection using Machine Learning
<br>
In this project we compare multiple classifier algorithms and analyze their accuracy, namely; SVM classifier, Random forest classifier, Decision tree, Naive bayes and Neural network.

Objectives
* Build a model to detect the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s disease in an individual.
* Early Detection of the disease to facilitate clinical monitoring of elderly people and increase their life span.
* Compare multiple classifier algorithms and analyze their accuracy.
